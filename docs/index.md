# Hourly

Our proposed solution is to develop a web application
for Office Hours scheduling, sign-up, and queue maintaining.
This will allow for the flexibility of the course staff
to alter their Office Hours as needed while keeping the students informed,
as well as ensuring that each student that signs up will be accounted for and not overlooked.
By using sign-ups, we can prioritize those who sign up over drop-ins
as well as allow students to see how busy a given Office Hours will be
so they can decide whether to attend or try a different session.
Additionally, this will hold the students more accountable
for planning their time about when to attend office hours and
should prevent large amounts of students from flooding a specific session.

### Office Hours
